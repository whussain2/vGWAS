# General
This repository  contains all the scripts and data used for the manuscript: "Variance-heterogeneity genome-wide mapping for cadmium in bread wheat revealed novel genomic loci and epistatic interactions".  Preprint is available at [will be available soon](soon). 
###### Aim: The main purpose of this work was to model the variance-heterogeneity in the context of GWAS, called as vGWAS to seek the genomic regions affecting the variance-heterogeneity of grain cadmium content in hard-red winter wheat.
# Contents
All the R codes for Principle component analysis, Double generalized linear model (DGLM), Hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM), and figures for manuscript can be found in R_Markdown_files. 

The raw data used to run the DGLM and HGLM analysis is available in Data folder under Raw_Data.

The output generated from DGLM and HGLM analysis and plot the circular Manhattan plot is available in folder vGWAS_output.
