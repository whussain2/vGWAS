# General
This repository  contains all the scripts and data used for the manuscript: "Variance-heterogeneity genome-wide mapping for cadmium in bread wheat revealed novel genomic loci and epistatic interactions".  Preprint is available at [will be available soon](soon). All the R codes for Principle component analysis, Double generalized linear model (DGLM), Hierarchical generalized linear model (HGLM), and figures for manuscript can be found in R_Markdown_files.  The data used to run the DGLM and HGLM analysis is available in data folder.

## Aim: The main purpose of this work was to model the variance-heterogeneity in the context of GWAS, called as vGWAS to seek the genomic regions affecting the variance-heterogeneity of grain cadmium content.
